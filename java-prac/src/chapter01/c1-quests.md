## `program2.java`

Make a program that takes three double values as $a$, $b$, $c$, and calculate the $x$ value using following formula:

$$x = \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{ b^{2} - 4ac } }{2a} $$

* You have to make sure $b^{2} - 4ac \geq 0$ and $a \neq 0$

## `program3.java` (Challenge)

Make a program that takes multiple pairs of values of $x$ and $y$ depending on the amount of $n$ and calculate the value of $β$ *(βήτα)*.

$$ \hat{\beta} = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}\nolimits^n (x_{i} - \bar{x} )(y_{i} - \bar{y} ) }{ \sum_{i=1}\nolimits^n (x_{i} - \bar{x} )^{2} }$$

* $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ are the average of the $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$, respectively.
* $n$ is the total pair of data and it will be $(x_{i}, y_{i}), i=1, 2, 3, ..., n.$

## `program4.java`

An airline describes airfare as follows. An economy ticket's base cost is $\$190$, business ticket costs $\$300$, and first class ticket costs $\$800$. Persons aged $60$ or over have a $25\%$ off discount for all types of ticket. Children $2$ or under are ticket-free. A carry-on bag costs $\$30$. A first checked bag is free, second is $\$25$, and each additional is $\$50$. Given inputs of age, carry-on ($0$ or $1$), and checked bags ($0$ or greater), compute the total airfare.
